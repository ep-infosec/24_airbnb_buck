      Output directory for build artifacts.

    <p>
    Buck stores build artifacts in a directory named <code>buck-out</code> in 
    the root of your {call buck.key_concepts_link}{param rendered_text: 'project' /}{/call}.
    </p>

    <p>
    You should not make assumptions about where Buck places your build
    artifacts within the directory structure beneath <code>buck-out</code> as 
    these locations depend on Buck's implementation and could potentially
    change over time. Instead, to obtain the location of the build
    artifact for a particular target, use the <code>--show-output</code> option 
    with the {call buck.cmd_build /} or the {call buck.cmd_targets /} command.
    </p>

{/literal}
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<pre>
{literal}
buck build --show-output &#x3C;target>
{/literal}
</pre>
</p>

    <p>
    You can also obtain the locations of your build artifacts by specifying
    either the <code>--build-report</code> or
    <code>--keep-going</code> options with <code>buck build</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Note that <code>--show-output</code> is going to be deprecated soon for <code>buck build</code>
    &nbsp; and replaced with <code>--show-outputs</code>. <code>--show-outputs</code> may print more
    than one build artifact per build target.
