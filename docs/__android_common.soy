{template .manifest_apk_arg}
{call buck.arg}
  {param name: 'manifest' /}
  {param default: 'None' /}
  {param desc}
    Relative path to the Android manifest for the APK.  The common
    case is that the manifest will be in the same directory as the
    rule, in which case this will simply be
    {sp}<code>'AndroidManifest.xml'</code>, but it can also reference
    an {call buck.android_manifest /} rule.

    Prefer using <code>manifest_skeleton</code>, which performs merging automatically.
    Exactly one of <code>manifest</code> and <code>manifest_skeleton</code> must be set.

    Relative path to the skeleton Android manifest for the APK.
    An {call buck.android_manifest /} will be created automatically to merge
    all manifests from libraries and resources going into the app.
    The common case is that the manifest will be in the same directory as the
    rule, in which case this will simply be
    {sp}<code>'AndroidManifest.xml'</code>.

    Exactly one of <code>manifest</code> and <code>manifest_skeleton</code> must be set.

  List of build targets whose corresponding compiled Java code,
  Android resources, and native libraries will be included in the APK.
