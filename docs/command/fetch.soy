{call buck.command}
{param overview}
<p>
  A command that fetches one or more resources defined by {call buck.remote_file /} rules. This
  should generally be run before {call buck.cmd_build /} if {call buck.remote_file /} rules are used
  in the repository. You must specify one or more {call buck.build_target /}s on the command line.
</p>
<p>
  Buck will look at the transitive dependencies of the target you specify, so it is usually best to
  specify your top-level target in order to get all the remote objects you require.
</p>
<pre>buck fetch /&#x2F;third-party/jetty:jetty-source</pre>
<p>
  We strongly believe that you and your team will have a better experience if you check your
  dependencies into your repository and use one of the provided <code>prebuilt_</code> rules
  instead. The Buck team encourages you to stop trying to make fetch happen.
