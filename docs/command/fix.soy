{call buck.command}
  {param overview}
  <p>Attempts to fix errors and warnings encountered during the previous command.</p>
  <p>Commands such as {call buck.cmd_build /} may fail with errors from Buck itself or another tool
  (such as a compiler or linker) that is invoked by Buck. In some cases, such errors can be fixed
  automatically. In such cases, running

  <pre>buck fix</pre>

  may fix the error.</p>

  <p><code>buck fix</code> prints nothing to the console unless a catastrophic failure occurs.</p>
  <p>
  Note that <code>buck fix</code> will edit files in place. It is therefore recommended that any
  pending changes be saved to source control before running this command.
