        <p>
          In general, we recommend 
          using <code>buck kill</code> rather than <code>buck killall</code>.
          The <code>buck killall</code> command is an aggressive way of
          terminating the <code>buckd</code> processes and might leave
          your build environment in an inconsistent state.
