{param overview}
The <code>flatten_dicts()</code> function is used to merge a list of dicts together. It is
useful for sharing a set of defaults across different build rules while allowing for customization.

You will probably want to use it in conjunction with <code>include_defs()</code> in order to
easily share configurations between your BUCK files.
