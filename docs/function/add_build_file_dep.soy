{param overview}
The <code>add_build_file_dep()</code> function is used to mark a parse-time dependency
onto another file, to make sure the Buck's internal caches invalidate build files
correctly if that file is modified.

{param args}

{call buck.functionArg}
  {param desc}
  The first and only argument is a path. As with {call buck.fn_load /} and {call buck.fn_include_defs /},
  it looks similar to a build target because it starts with
  {sp}<code>//</code> (indicating the root of the project), but is not a
  proper build target because it identifies a file relative to the root of
  the project rather than a build rule.
