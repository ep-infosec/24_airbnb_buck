      The load() function is used to include definitions (macros and constants) from
      another file.

{call buck.function}
{param status: 'FROZEN' /}
{param overview}
The {call buck.fn_load/} function is used to include definitions ({call buck.macros/} and constants)
from another file.
<p>
The {call buck.fn_load/} function executes a file of build-file-style
code in the context of the current build file, so code in the included file may
reference Buck functions, such as {call buck.java_library/}, {call buck.java_test/}, etc.,
as well as {call buck.fn_load/} itself!
<p>
The motivation behind {call buck.fn_load/} is to avoid
copy-and-pasting code across multiple build files. Often, loaded files will
contain data declarations (as shown in the example below) or definitions of
macros for creating more complex build rules.
{/param}

{param args}

{call buck.arg}
  {param name: 'label' /}
  {param desc}
  The label identifying file containing {call buck.macros/} and constants. It's
  exactly the same as build target syntax but all macro files are assumed to be
  implicitly exported using <code>buck.export_file</code> with its original name, so
  a macro file <code>defs</code> from <code>package</code> directory is accessible
  using <code>//package:defs</code> syntax.
  {/param}
{/call}

{call buck.arg}
  {param name: '**symbols' /}
  {param desc}
  Names of macros and constants to import from <code>path</code>. In {call buck.fn_load/} function
  keyword arguments have special meaning and can be used to change names of imported symbols. For
  example, <code>load("//tools/build_rules:build_defs", my_rule="some_rule")</code> will export{sp}
  <code>some_rule</code> from <code>build_defs</code> and make it available under the name{sp}
  <code>my_rule</code>. This can be useful to avoid name collisions with local definitions.
  {/param}
{/call}

{/param}

{param examples}
Suppose the file <code>core/DEFS</code> contains the following:
{literal}<pre class="prettyprint lang-py">
JARS_TO_EXCLUDE_FROM_DX = [
  'third_party/guava/guava-14.0.1.jar',
  'third_party/jackson/jackson-core-2.9.7.jar',
  'third_party/jackson/jackson-databind-2.9.7.jar',
  'third_party/jackson/jackson-datatype-guava-2.9.7.jar',
]
</pre>{/literal}

Then another build file could include the array using
{sp}<code>load()</code>. This eliminates the need to
copy-and-paste definitions across build files:

{literal}<pre class="prettyprint lang-py">
load('//core:DEFS', 'JARS_TO_EXCLUDE_FROM_DX')

android_binary(
  name = 'example',
  # ...
  no_dx = JARS_TO_EXCLUDE_FROM_DX,
)
</pre>{/literal}

Alternatively, to make an imported symbol available under a different name,
keywords can be used instead:
{literal}<pre class="prettyprint lang-py">
load('//core:DEFS', no_dx='JARS_TO_EXCLUDE_FROM_DX')

android_binary(
  name = 'example',
  # ...
  no_dx = no_dx,
)
</pre>{/literal}

{/param}

{/call} // buck.function
    {/param} // content
  {/call}
{/template}
