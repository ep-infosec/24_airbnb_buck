      The name of the package being evaluated. For example, in the build file <code>some/package/BUCK</code>, its value will be <code>some/package</code>. If the BUCK file calls a function defined in a .bzl file, <code>package_name()</code> will match the caller BUCK file package. This function is equivalent to the deprecated variable <code>PACKAGE_NAME</code>.
