This tool (fbxctest) needs to be updated when moving to a new Xcode version.
There's a script for this: scripts/update-xctest.sh

The script will more-or-less do the following for you:
1. Download and build xctool from https://github.com/facebook/xctool.
2. You will need to move the lib folder to the directory of fbxctest.
3. Download and build fbxctest from https://github.com/facebook/FBSimulatorControl.
4. Move the contents of the build output directory to this directory.
5. Delete all headers, modules and related symlinks inside the frameworks.
