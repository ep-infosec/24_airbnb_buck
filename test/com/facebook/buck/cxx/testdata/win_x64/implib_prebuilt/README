To generate the prebuilt library used in these tests:

1. Create a new Visual Studio static library solution name "implib_prebuilt"
2. Copy ../implib/MathLibrary.h and ../implib/MathLibrary.cpp into the solution
3. Build solution
4. Grab implib_prebuilt.lib, implib_prebuilt.dll, and implib_prebuilt.pdb from
    the x64/Release output folder
