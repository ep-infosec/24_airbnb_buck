/**
 * An abstract class that provides basic capabilities for commands that use subcommands loaded from
 * plugins.
 *
 * <p>Implementations of this class will have logic to control common logic of a particular
 * plugin-based command. For example, {@code buck project} command will have an implementation that
 * implements this class and adds some common domain-independent logic to route a particular
 * invocation to some implementation loaded from plugins.
 *
 * <p>Typical example of usage:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   class ExamplePluginBasedCommand extends PluginBasedCommand {
 *    {@literal @}PluginBasedSubCommands(factoryClass = ExamplePluginBasedSubCommandFactory.class)
 *    {@literal @}SuppressFieldNotInitialized
 *     private ImmutableList<ExamplePluginBasedSubCommand> modes;
 *
 *    {@literal @}Override
 *     protected ImmutableList<? extends PluginBasedSubCommand> getSubCommands() {
 *       return modes;
 *     }
 *
 *    {@literal @}Override
 *     protected String getTypeOptionName() {
 *       return "--mode";
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   interface ExamplePluginBasedSubCommandFactory extends PluginBasedSubCommandFactory {
 *   }
 *
 *   {@literal @}Extention
 *   class SomeExamplePluginBasedSubCommand implements ExamplePluginBasedSubCommandFactory {
 *     {@literal @}Override
 *     SomeExamplePluginBasedSubCommand createSubCommand() {
 *       return new SomeExamplePluginBasedSubCommand();
 *     }
 *   }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Key points:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Sub commands needs to be instantiated using factories
 *   <li>Plugin subcommand factories have to implement {@code PluginBasedSubCommandFactory}.
 *   <li>Plugin subcommands have to implement {@code PluginBasedSubCommand}.
 *   <li>{@link #getTypeOptionName} is used to control which option is used to select a subcommand.
 *       The logic in this class uses that method for help screen only. The particular
 *       implementations need to use the option with that name to select a particular subcommand.
 * </ul>
