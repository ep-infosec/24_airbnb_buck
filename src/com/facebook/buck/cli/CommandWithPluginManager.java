 * An implementation of {@link Command} that allows keeping {@link PluginManager}.

 * Command} are created by the args4j framework by calling the default constructor (the one without
 * arguments). The {@link PluginManager} is saved by calling {@link
 * #setPluginManager(PluginManager)} right after the creation of the command. Also, CLI arguments
 * are parsed on a single thread so we don't need to worry about concurrent access.
