We currently have a fork of trace-viewer due to the following unresolved issue:
https://github.com/google/trace-viewer/issues/483

This issue was filed on the code.google.com version of trace-viewer.
Google marked it closed even though there was a simple repro case that
demonstrated that it was busted.

We should probably test things out on an updated version to see if things
have improved. If not, we should reopen the GitHub issue.
