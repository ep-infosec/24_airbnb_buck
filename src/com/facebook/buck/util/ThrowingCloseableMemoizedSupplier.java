 * Convenience wrapper class to attach closeable functionality to suppliers of resources to be

 * them.
 *

 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * class Main {
 *  public static void main() {
 *    try (ThrowingCloseableMemoizedSupplier<Resource, Exception> closeableSupplier =
 *        ThrowingCloseableMemoizedSupplier.of(Resource::new, resource::shutDown)) {

 *        useResource(closeableSupplier.get())
 *      }
 *    }
 *  }
 * }
 *
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>The above will only construct the Resource if condition is true, and close the constructed
 * resource appropriately.
