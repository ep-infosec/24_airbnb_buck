/**
 * This class implements a map for a filesystem structure relying on a prefix tree. The trie only
 * supports relative paths for now, but an effort can be made in order to let it support absolute
 * paths if needed. Every intermediate or leaf node of the trie is a folder/file which may be
 * associated with a value. It's worth noting that adding a value for path foo/bar/file.txt will add
 * intermediate nodes for foo and foo/bar but not values. The value is associated with the specified
 * path and not with its ancestors. Invalidating one of the leaves or intermediate nodes will cause
 * its parent and its ancestors to be invalidated as well: this operation consists in removing the
 * leaf from its parent children and setting the value of all its ancestors to null. If the removal
 * of the target leaf leaves an empty branch (a stump), that is removed as well in order to keep the
 * prefix tree as slim as possible.
 *
 * <p>This class is thread safe in its public methods: concurrent calls to the trie will have the
 * exclusiveness in write/remove operations, while allowing parallel reads to the whole data
 * structure: an attempt could be made to make the trie more concurrent by locking branches of the
 * trie instead of the whole object, although that will require some thought around how to grant
 * parallel writes.
 *
 * @param <T> The type to associate with a specific path.
