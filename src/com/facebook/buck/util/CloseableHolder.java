/**
 * CloseableHolder is used to pass ownership of a Closeable. This can make it easier to properly
 * close the underlying Closeable.
 *
 * <p>For example, in the following code, if writeSomethingToTempFile() throws an exception, the
 * tempFile will be deleted, but otherwise the ownership is passed to
 * doSomethingAsyncWithTempFile().
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * try (CloseableHolder<NamedTemporaryFile> tempFile = new CloseableHolder<>(createTempFile())) {
 *   writeSomethingToTempFile(tempFile.get());
 *   doSomethingAsyncWithTempFile(tempFile.release());
 * }
