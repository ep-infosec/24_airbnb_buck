version
-------
This file stores the version of thrift currently being used. Although it doesn't
strictly have to be a version number. It is only relevant as a string for use in
pattern-matching in update.sh.

** Some notes about the current version **
libthrift-0.10.0 has a bug where TServiceClient grabs System.out and prints an
unconditional log message. https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1173 fixes it,
but it will only be available in the next thrift release. The current version of
libthrift jar files have the fix cherry-picked on top of the 0.10.0 branch.

Steps to obtain the jar files:

   git clone https://github.com/apache/thrift
   git checkout -b v10-with-hotfix 0.10.0
   git cherry-pick 34bd992bc3104517062482ec837d4b49d33963ef
   ant dist pack.src
   cp build/*.jar ~/buck/third-party/java/thrift/

update.sh
---------
This is a best-effort script to update thrift to the system-version and re-generate all sources.
It grabs the .jar files from the maven repository.

gen.sh
------
This script re-generates all thrift sources from checked-in thrift files.
