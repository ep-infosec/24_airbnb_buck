Bundletool is a command-line tool to manipulate and build Android App Bundles - https://g.co/androidappbundle
We use it to build the final android bundle, after building each bundle module

Built from source from https://github.com/google/bundletool, 
commit SHA 8f922cf4b24bb1714d06cfa303d8e79e81b71a91 with the following modifications:

* Patch to allow the output file from BuildBundleCommand to be overwritten: 
  https://github.com/google/bundletool/pull/139

* Modified jar manually to remove obfuscated files from the 
  shadow/bundletool/com/android/tools/r8 package, which have mixed case. Due
  to a bug in Buck, these paths cause an internal error on Windows.

Release Number: 0.12.0 + patch
