Compiler stub jar was created as follows:
   buck build src/com/facebook/buck/jvm/java/abi:api-stubber
   java -jar buck-out/gen/src/com/facebook/buck/jvm/java/abi/api-stubber.jar ${JAVA_HOME}/lib/tools.jar stub-compiler-tree-api.jar
   <a bunch of calls to `zip -d` to delete files that aren't part of the Tree API>
